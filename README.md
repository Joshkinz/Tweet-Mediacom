# Tweet-Mediacom
Checks if internet is down, tweets at Mediacom when it's back

## Requirements

Python 3

python-twitter (pip install python-twitter)

## Install

**You must make a config.json file to run this properly!**

It should look like this:

```json
{
	"consumer-key" : "key",
	"consumer-secret" : "key",
	"access-token" : {
		"key" : "key",
		"secret" : "key"
	}
}
```
You can get the information for this from [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com)
